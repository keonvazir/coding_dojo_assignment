1) Don't rename/change the file names for .py files (especially) after you establish them. Also same goes with folder and SQL database names

2) very important that everything matches in the names and the from ... import section. Otherwise it won't link up

3) keep the server.py and msqlconnection.py in the same folder

4) might want to download instead of copy and pasting the code for formatting issues

5) make sure everything is indented as intended, it really makes a huge difference.

Main thing is to make sure the names you assign variables and tables all match up. And that everything in your Python file are properly indented.
